Only the source files of ROS part

<b>DISCLAIMER</b> : Backup <b>ALL</b> local changes of <b>src</b> directory to other storage before you move on.

1. Move to your workspace directory. Issuing <code>ls</code> will show like: <br>
<code> build/   devel/    README.md   src/</code> <br><br>

2. Move in to <code>src</code> directory, and issue the command to clean up the directory. <br>
<code>rm -rf .* *</code>

3. Finally, still in <code>src</code> directory, issue the following command to fetch your local repository: <br>
<code>git clone https://github.com/thanhndv212/capstone_1_ROS/ .</code>

Now, you can push/pull your code in <code>src</code> directory. If you had any changes before step 1, replace and commit the file later on.
